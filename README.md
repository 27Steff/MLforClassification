# MLforClassification

In this project, I made an analysis of an anime database that has various attributes such as release dates, studios, producers, types, and popularity metrics. Using machine learning techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers, I aimed to train models for genre classification and ratings prediction.

Used database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-anime-dataset-2024

### Methodology:
 
Data Collection and Preprocessing: After collecting the data I preprocessed the data to handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare it for analysis.

Data Analisis: I made an analysis of the database, having in count various attributes such as release dates, studios, producers, types, and popularity metrics

Feature Engineering: Utilizing techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and cosine similarity, I extracted features from the anime descriptions.

Model Training: We employed KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms for genre classification and rating prediction. KNN utilized the similarity between anime descriptions to classify new entries, while Naive Bayes leveraged probabilistic principles to predict ratings based on the description.

Model Evaluation: To assess the performance of our models, we employed cross-validation techniques and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This evaluation ensured the reliability and generalizability of our models.
