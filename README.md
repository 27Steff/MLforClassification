# MLforClassification

In this project, I made an analysis of an anime database that has various attributes such as release dates, studios, producers, types, and popularity metrics. Using machine learning techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers, I aimed to train models for genre classification and ratings prediction.
